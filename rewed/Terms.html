    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Wedeption (“Wedeption”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) operates a wedding and event planning platform that provides users
        with access to wedding-related information, vendor listings, recommendations, and related services through its
        website and mobile applications (collectively, the “Wedeption Services”).
    </p>
    <p>
        Wedeption is a technology and aggregation platform that connects users with independent wedding and event service
        providers (“Vendors”). Wedeption does not itself provide wedding or event services.
